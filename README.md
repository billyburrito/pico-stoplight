# pico-stoplight
An indicator for your home office or regular office

Needs the picozero lib installed (easy to install libs with Thonny)

I used 100ohm resistors coming off the gpio of the pico for all the leds.

Prototyped on a breadboard for now, but will add a 3d printable case.

The pico will display the IP it gets on stdout, otherwise, good luck :D
